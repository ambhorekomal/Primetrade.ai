# Bitcoin Market Sentiment vs Trader Performance

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project explores the relationship between **market sentiment (Fear vs Greed)** and **trader performance** (profitability, leverage usage, volume, and position sizing).  
The goal is to identify hidden behavioral patterns among traders under different sentiment regimes and extract insights to build smarter trading strategies.
