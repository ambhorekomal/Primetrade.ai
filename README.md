### On Colab (Recommended)
1. Upload `csv_files/` to your session
2. Open `notebook_1.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
4. Outputs will be auto-saved in `/outputs/`

### Local Setup
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn reportlab
jupyter notebook
| File             | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| notebook_1.ipynb | Full analysis code and visualizations |
| ds_report.pdf    | Final summary with insights           |
| csv_files/       | All raw and processed datasets        |
| outputs/         | All generated graphs                  |
